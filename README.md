# spotify-genres
Analysis of Spotify data to look at genres in listening history

The project is written in Python and R for getting and cleaning data, and making graphs, respectively. The first portion in python reads in .json files, pulls artist genres from the Spotify API, and formats the data nicely before exporting it as a .csv file. The second portion in R takes the .csv file produced and uses it to make graphs in ggplot.
